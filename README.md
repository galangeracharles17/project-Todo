# project-Todo

Todo list to supplement my learning in ReactJs and Javascript, styled with SCSS to explore the preprocessor of CSS

This project was created from scratch using ReactJs and Javascript with the help of SCSS

The actual design was also from scratch using figma and material icons.

NodeJS keypoints

> Node allows you to install packages from diffrence resources
> Node checks if the app was successfully built
> Node will also let your application run on your local machine

Git keypoints

> Is version control that let's you track your progress
> Allows to keep in sync with your github repositories

ReactJS keypoints

> DOM Manipulation
> React Hooks
> such as useState, useEffect, useRef and useCallback
> Understanding how reacts rerender and how it is similar with snapshots

Javascript keypoints

> Object destructuring
> Array destructuring
> Data stuctures like map and filter
> Handling array and object by creating another reference to avoid mutation

If you're interested on adding some feature here's the step by step to run it on your local machine

> Download the file or clone it on my github
> Locate the files using using your terminal
> Install the packages
> -- $ npm install
> Then run it on your local machine by
> -- $ npm run dev

Optional if you want it to deploy on github pages

> npm run deploy

That's all thank you!
